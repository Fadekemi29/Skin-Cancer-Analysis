## Project Overview
This project investigates over 1,000 clinical cases of skin cancer using SQL queries and statistical analysis to uncover diagnostic patterns, environmental and demographic risk factors, and lesion characteristics. The goal is to improve early detection and enable ML-ready datasets for future predictive models in dermatology.

## Data Highlights

- **Environmental Factors**:
- 45% of malignant cases involve pesticide exposure
- 80% of precancerous cases lack proper sewage or piped water access

- **Demographic Patterns**:
- Highest cancer prevalence in males aged 50–69 with history of smoking and alcohol use
- Malignant cases had the highest association with skin cancer history (45%) and other cancer history (54%)

- **Lesion Characteristics**:
- Melanoma average lesion size: 197.58mm²
- Biopsy inconsistencies: precancerous lesions frequently symptomatic but not confirmed via biopsy

- **Risk Cohorts**:
- 50+ high-risk patients flagged for priority follow-up

## Tech Stack
- PostgreSQL + pgAdmin
- Microsoft Excel
- Microsoft PowerPoint

## Recommendations
- Policy-level interventions to control pesticide exposure
- Active monitoring of symptomatic yet biopsy-negative cases
- Early screening protocols for aging demographics
- ML model development using lesion and environmental features

## Next Steps
This dataset forms the backbone for predictive modeling in healthcare diagnostics, driving machine learning development, research studies, and public health initiatives.
